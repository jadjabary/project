Dear [Employer's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to come to work today due to the recent traumatic event that I experienced at the Allen Outlet Mall. As you may already know, there was a mass shooting that occurred in the mall, and unfortunately, I was present during the incident.

I am still feeling extremely shaken and distressed by the events that took place, and I believe it would be in the best interest of my mental health to take a day off from work to focus on self-care and processing my emotions. I hope you can understand the severity of the situation and the impact it has had on me.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure that any pending tasks are completed upon my return.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
