Dear Jon,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend the mandatory in-person get-together and work travel to Arizona scheduled for early June due to unforeseen circumstances related to my caregiving responsibilities for my father.

As you may be aware, my father, who is in his late 70s, is currently dealing with serious medical conditions that require continuous care and attention. In recent weeks, his health condition has become more unstable, necessitating constant monitoring and assistance. As his primary caregiver, I have an indispensable role in ensuring his well-being and providing him with the necessary support during this challenging time.

Given the circumstances, I regretfully must decline participation in the upcoming work travel event. It is essential that I remain present to address any unforeseen medical emergencies, provide necessary medications, and manage his daily routines. As a caregiver, I bear the responsibility of ensuring his comfort and safety, and I cannot compromise his care by being away during this critical period.

I understand the significance of this event and the value of in-person interactions for team building and collaboration. However, I kindly request your understanding and support in excusing my absence on this occasion due to these extenuating circumstances. I assure you that I am committed to my role and will make every effort to contribute remotely, participate in virtual meetings, and remain engaged with the team's objectives while attending to my caregiving duties.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my inability to attend the event, and I appreciate your understanding and consideration of my circumstances. 

Thanks
Jad
