Dear Kathy,

I am writing to urgently address the distressing situation caused by Jon's behavior, which has had a profound and detrimental impact on my physical and mental well-being. The immense stress, relentless pressure, and manipulation I have endured under Jon's supervision have led to a distressing physical episode, resulting in my hospitalization. It is with great shock and disbelief that I found myself in an incredibly compromising and humiliating situation upon regaining consciousness, having passed out due to an IBS flare-up triggered by the extreme stress inflicted by Jon.

The severity of my condition necessitated immediate medical attention, and I was admitted to the hospital, where I received extensive treatment. The medical professionals expressed their deep concern about the toll that chronic stress, caused by the toxic work environment Jon has created, has taken on my overall health and well-being. They administered 2 liters of intravenous fluids to replenish my depleted resources and support my recovery.

I must express my profound disappointment and grave concern about this distressing situation. Throughout my tenure, I have consistently strived to perform my duties diligently and with unwavering dedication. However, the persistently toxic work environment fostered by Jon has made it increasingly challenging for me to maintain my productivity and well-being.

I implore you to address this matter urgently, conduct a thorough investigation into Jon's behavior, and take appropriate actions to rectify this situation. It is crucial to foster a workplace environment that values respect, support, and the well-being of its employees.

I kindly request the opportunity to discuss this matter further in person or through a confidential meeting. Your prompt attention to this issue and efforts to restore a healthier work environment will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this pressing matter.

Sincerely,

Jad
