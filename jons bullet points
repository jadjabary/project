In response to the points raised in your email, I want to address them truthfully and transparently. Firstly, it's important to clarify that I did not take any PTO as you suggested. I actively worked with IT to resolve the password issue, and as evidence of my dedication and engagement, I promptly sent you my GitLab merge request. This clearly demonstrates my commitment to fulfilling my work responsibilities. Please refrain from making false statements about me taking PTO when I was actively involved in resolving the technical challenge at hand. Despite the password reset affecting my access to Microsoft Teams, I made every effort to fulfill my responsibilities and contribute to the ongoing tasks. As I have mentioned before, it's important for you as a manager to be aware of the password reset protocols implemented by IT, which occur every three months. Given this policy, it is reasonable to expect potential challenges in accessing necessary platforms. I did open a ticket with the Help Desk to address the technical issues, and I have documented proof of my collaboration. The claim that I was unavailable for almost two hours is unfounded. It is well-known that Mac support typically takes longer than Windows support, and it took approximately two hours for the support team to reach out to me. The state of my personal phone, including voicemail settings, is unrelated to my work responsibilities.

Furthermore, it's important to address the issue of communication and access. While managing my personal device is my responsibility, I believe it would be beneficial for State Farm to provide a work phone to ensure seamless communication and to save work-related contacts. As a manager, it is your responsibility to understand the password reset protocols and their potential impact on access, and to provide alternative means of communication or ensure that necessary details are communicated to me in advance. Regarding the claim that you had to initiate contact with me, I recall that you reached out to me first. This is because there is no established means for me to get in touch with you as I do not have your number saved, and I prioritize deleting spam emails from my personal account. Given the circumstances, it would be prudent for State Farm to provide a company phone to facilitate better communication and avoid such challenges. Despite my status appearing as offline, I was actively engaged in my work offline and even submitted a GitLab merge request as evidence of my productivity. The claim that I did not communicate with leadership or attempt to join the daily sync is misleading. Due to the password reset, I did not have access to Microsoft Teams, which made it impossible for me to join the sync meeting or notify you in advance. As a manager, it is crucial for you to understand and accommodate these technical challenges.

Additionally, it is inaccurate to state that you had to initiate contact with me to inquire about my work. I did open a ticket with the Help Desk for the technical issues I encountered, and I have records to demonstrate my cooperation. The claim that I was unavailable for almost two hours is false. Mac support generally takes longer than Windows support, and it took approximately two hours for support to reach out to me. Finally, I could not attend the 1x1 due to the lack of access to Teams and the absence of meeting details provided. It is crucial to address these concerns accurately and objectively, focusing on finding resolutions and maintaining a fair and professional working environment.
