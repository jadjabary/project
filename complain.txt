My message to Jon

Subject: Clarification and Response to Concerns

Jon,

I wanted to address the concerns and statements mentioned in your previous email regarding my attendance, communication, and the expectations placed upon me as a hybrid employee. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify certain points.

Firstly, I must emphasize that as a manager, it is essential to be proactive in reading all communication channels, including Microsoft Teams and Text messages. I have a documented track record of reaching out to you and meeting organizers whenever I cannot attend a meeting due to my medical condition, IBS, which requires frequent restroom breaks. Furthermore, I have evidence of requesting meeting recordings when I cannot be present. Therefore, stating that I did not communicate or inform you of changes is inaccurate. I have always strived to maintain timely and open communication.

Regarding my online status, I assure you that I am consistently online and available. It is incorrect to suggest that I am offline for extended periods. I have a record of responding promptly to your messages, and any insinuation otherwise is unfounded.

In your email, you mentioned that it is expected for me to notify you in advance if I need to reschedule a meeting due to my medical condition. I would like to highlight that the expectation should also extend to you, as the manager, to inform me ahead of time before scheduling meetings. This ensures that I can plan accordingly and make the necessary arrangements. Additionally, it is crucial to acknowledge that needing to use the restroom due to my IBS does not constitute the need for Life Leave time off, as it is a medical condition that requires intermittent breaks.

Moving on to the section regarding my presence in the office, I want to clarify that I did attend the office on Tuesday to acquire my badge. I also attended all the scheduled meetings during that week. However, due to the distressing events that occurred on Tuesday, I felt uncomfortable and apprehensive about going to the office on Wednesday and Thursday. I expressed these concerns during our meeting with the director. Regarding being on camera, I kindly request that you hold a consistent standard across all employees, as I have noticed that you, yourself, do not turn on your camera during group team meetings.

Regarding the action items you outlined, I believe there is a miscommunication or misunderstanding. It is incorrect to insinuate that I took time off when I did not. I have documented evidence in the form of text messages between us, as well as communication with Todd, highlighting issues with my Microsoft Teams presence and functionality. It is evident that I have made efforts to communicate these technical challenges and express my intention to attend and record missed meetings. I mentioned my absence from the meeting with Todd due to my IBS condition and my reluctance to share this personal information with colleagues.

As for the task assigned to me, I have a clear plan in place. I intend to complete the current task before moving on to the next. I assure you that my commitment to fulfilling my responsibilities remains unwavering. It is essential not to rush to judgment or draw conclusions that may paint an inaccurate picture of my dedication and work ethic.

Lastly, in regards to the proposed daily status meeting involving Krishna, yourself, and me, I must express my concern. It appears to me that this meeting is being imposed as a form of punishment following the events in our meeting with the director. This treatment feels unfair and inconsistent, especially considering that I have documented evidence demonstrating that you do not conduct these mandatory 1x1 daily camera-on meetings with other team members.

I believe it is crucial for us to address these concerns and misunderstandings to foster a more productive and respectful work environment. I am committed to maintaining open communication and resolving any issues or miscommunications that arise. I kindly request that we discuss these matters further to find a mutually beneficial resolution.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to addressing these concerns together and continuing to contribute effectively in my role as a Software Engineer.

Sincerely,
Jad

Message to HR 

Dear HR,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to address the concerns raised in the recent communication from my manager, Jon, regarding my attendance, meeting participation, and communication. I would like to provide you with the accurate account of events and refute the false allegations made against me.

Firstly, Jon's assertion that I have missed meetings without notifying the host or himself is entirely untrue. As per Jon's own instructions, I have consistently communicated my absence in advance and provided documentation in Microsoft Teams to notify both the meeting organizer and Jon about my unavailability. Furthermore, I have taken the initiative to request that meeting organizers record the sessions for me, ensuring that I remain up-to-date with the discussions. I have maintained thorough documentation of these communications as evidence of my proactive approach.

In addition to addressing these concerns, I am also writing to formally file a complaint against my manager, Mr. Jon Kiner, regarding the recent issues and retaliatory actions that have occurred in our working relationship. I believe these actions violate the principles of fairness, understanding, and adherence to company policies.

Since joining State Farm, I have proactively communicated my medical condition, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), to Mr. Kiner, ensuring he was aware of the potential impact on my work schedule. Despite my efforts to be transparent and maintain open lines of communication, Mr. Kiner has consistently disregarded my condition and attempted to force me into an in-office work arrangement, which is both impractical and contrary to the accommodations I require due to my medical condition.
As a result of Mr. Kiner's actions, I have experienced the following:
Increased stress and anxiety
Difficulty sleeping
Difficulty concentrating
Feelings of isolation and frustration

Regarding the meeting with Director Kathy on Monday, June 12th, it appears to have been a calculated scheme orchestrated by Jon with the intention of damaging my reputation and seeking retribution for my decision not to travel to Arizona. It is crucial to emphasize that I diligently followed Jon's instructions to visit the office on Tuesday, June 6th, where I obtained my badge. Unfortunately, due to my pre-existing medical condition, which I had previously discussed with Jon, I experienced discomfort that compelled me to work remotely for the rest of the week. Given these circumstances, it was unreasonable for Jon to expect my physical presence in the office on subsequent days.

In fact, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to remaining engaged and informed, even when unable to attend in-person meetings. On multiple occasions, I proactively communicated with meeting hosts to record the proceedings when I knew in advance that I would be unable to attend. This approach ensured that I stayed up-to-date with the discussions and contributed my insights despite my physical limitations. My track record clearly demonstrates my conscientiousness in notifying hosts whenever I anticipated missing a meeting due to health-related reasons. I have always prioritized open communication and ensuring that my colleagues were well-informed about my circumstances.

The recent incident involving Mr. Kiner's attempt to arrange a meeting with Director Kathy on Monday, June 12th, supposedly to discuss my performance, was simply an endeavor to discredit and penalize me for a situation beyond my control. Throughout the meeting, I was unjustly accused of falling short of expectations regarding in-office attendance, meeting participation, and communication with upper management. It is crucial to acknowledge that I have consistently followed the necessary protocols to inform Mr. Kiner whenever I am unable to attend a meeting or fulfill my job responsibilities due to health-related reasons.

Furthermore, Jon's claim that I worked only half a day on Thursday due to missing a meeting is categorically false. I explicitly communicated my unavailability to the meeting organizer and requested that the session be recorded. Jon's allegation is unsupported and contradicted by the documented evidence I possess.

I am deeply concerned about Jon's inappropriate request for me to either turn on my camera while using the restroom or file for leave due to my irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This demand places me in an uncomfortable and unfair position as an employee. It is important to highlight that neither Jon nor the majority of team members, including Jon himself, adhere to a policy of keeping their cameras on during team meetings. Therefore, singling me out and imposing such a requirement is both discriminatory and unnecessary.

Moreover, Jon's claim that I am not seen as "online" is factually incorrect. I have consistently maintained my online presence throughout work hours, and I have the necessary documentation to substantiate this claim, which proves that Jon's statement lacks accuracy.
It is worth noting that Jon's management style disproportionately targets and micromanages me, while my colleagues, such as Priti and Austin, are not subjected to the same level of scrutiny. This inconsistency is evident in the documentation I have maintained, further highlighting Jon's biased treatment towards me.

Lastly, I would like to address Jon's assertion that I am not allowed to reschedule meetings if they do not work for me. It is essential to recognize that accommodating employee comfort and well-being should be a priority within the organization. Jon's refusal to consider my reasonable request to reschedule meetings demonstrates an unwillingness to support and understand the needs of the employees.

Considering the concerns I have raised, I kindly request that HR conducts a fair and impartial investigation into these matters. I trust that a thorough examination of the evidence, including the documentation I have provided, will substantiate my claims and expose the inaccuracies in Jon's allegations. It is necessary to address the hostile work environment created by Jon's actions and ensure that fair treatment and adherence to HR policies are maintained throughout the organization.

Moreover, the email I received from Mr. Kiner, which I have attached for your reference, further illustrates his disregard for my medical condition and his insistence on imposing unreasonable expectations. The email not only misrepresents my actions but also attempts to shift the blame onto me by citing policy violations that I have not committed.

In light of the aforementioned issues, I am kindly requesting your intervention and immediate assistance in resolving this matter. Specifically, I would appreciate your support in addressing the following concerns:

Ensuring a fair and equitable working environment that respects employees' personal circumstances, including disabilities and medical conditions.
I request that State Farm enforce policies that protect employees' rights to accommodation and reasonable adjustments for medical conditions such as IBS.
I request that Mr. Kiner be educated on the nature of my medical condition and be made aware of the necessary accommodations that should be provided.
Investigating the retaliatory actions and unfair treatment I have experienced at the hands of Mr. Kiner.
I request a thorough investigation into the incidents described, including the meeting with the director and the email communication from Mr. Kiner.
Providing guidance and education to Mr. Kiner regarding the appropriate handling of employee medical accommodations and ensuring compliance with company policies.
I request that Mr. Kiner receives training on accommodating employees with medical conditions and understanding the legal requirements and implications surrounding such accommodations.
Establishing clear communication channels between Mr. Kiner and myself, ensuring that he acknowledges and respects my health-related needs.
I request that State Farm facilitate effective communication between Mr. Kiner and me, ensuring that my health-related needs are acknowledged and respected.
Preventing any further retaliatory actions against me and guaranteeing that my professional growth and development are not hindered due to this situation.
I request that State Farm takes measures to protect me from any further retaliation and ensures that my professional growth and development are not negatively impacted by these incidents.
Requesting a team change to a different department or team within State Farm that can better accommodate my needs and provide a more supportive work environment.
I kindly request a transfer to a different department or team within State Farm that can provide an inclusive and supportive work environment, taking into consideration my medical condition and accommodation requirements.

Furthermore, I would like to address specific points mentioned in Mr. Kiner's email:
Mr. Kiner requested that I log Life Leave for restroom breaks due to my IBS condition. I believe this requirement is unreasonable and unnecessary. Restroom breaks are a common necessity for individuals with medical conditions, and I should not be required to utilize Life Leave for such breaks.
Mr. Kiner mentioned that I missed an important meeting and did not reach out to inquire about what I missed.
I want to clarify that I have made efforts to communicate my technical challenges and express my intention to attend and record missed meetings.
I specifically mentioned my absence from the meeting with Todd, citing my IBS condition and my hesitation to share personal information with colleagues.
Regarding the task assigned to me, I have a clear plan in place and will prioritize completing the current task before moving on to the next.
I want to emphasize my unwavering commitment to fulfilling my responsibilities and assure you of my dedication and work ethic.
It is important to avoid rushing to judgment or drawing conclusions that may inaccurately portray my commitment and work approach.
Mr. Kiner intends to set up a daily status meeting requiring my attendance and participation on camera.
This meeting feels like a form of retaliation and micromanagement following our director meeting, with the intention of driving me out of the company.
I have documented evidence demonstrating that this requirement is not consistent across the board with other team members.
It is evident that this meeting requirement is specifically targeted towards me, while others are not subjected to the same standard.
Due to these reasons, I will not attend these meetings as they are unfair and unjustly singling me out.
I may be unable to have my camera on at times due to my health reasons.
I am requesting appropriate accommodations to facilitate my participation in meetings without facing penalties for health-related limitations.

I believe that by addressing these concerns promptly and effectively, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive work environment at State Farm. I kindly request that you keep this complaint confidential to protect my privacy and prevent any potential further retaliation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am open to discussing the situation further and providing any additional information or documentation that may be required for a thorough investigation. I trust that you will handle this complaint with the utmost seriousness and work towards a fair resolution.

I look forward to your prompt response and a resolution that ensures a positive working environment for all employees.

Sincerely,
Jad Jabary
