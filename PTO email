Dear Jon,

Your false claim that I took PTO on June 29th is entirely baseless. I possess documented evidence of my active engagement on that day, including submitting a merge request and collaborating with the IT team to address my password issues.

I insist on an immediate rectification of my PTO records to reflect the truth accurately. I have no tolerance for your attempts to manipulate my hours and will take necessary action to protect my rights if this matter is not promptly resolved.

Consider this a final warning to cease these dishonest practices.

Jad
